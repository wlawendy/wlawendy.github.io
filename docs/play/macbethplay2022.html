			<p class="verseline">Confronted him with self-comparisons,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Point against point rebellious, arm ‘gainst arm,</p>

Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all-hailed me ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with ‘Hail, King that shalt be!’ This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”</p>

			<p class="character">Lennox</p>
			<p class="verseline">My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which can interpret farther; only I say</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead</p>
			<p class="verseline">And the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whom, you may say, if’t please you, Fleance kill’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous</p>
			<p class="verseline">It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</p>
			<p class="verseline">To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!</p>
			<p class="verseline">How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight,</p>
			<p class="verseline">In pious rage, the two delinquents tear</p>
			<p class="verseline">That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For ‘twould have anger’d any heart alive</p>
			<p class="verseline">To hear the men deny’t. So that, I say,</p>
			<p class="verseline">He has borne all things well; and I do think</p>
			<p class="verseline">That, had he Duncan’s sons under his key-</p>
			<p class="verseline">As, an’t please heaven, he shall not -they should find</p>
			<p class="verseline">What ‘twere to kill a father; so should Fleance</p>
			<p class="verseline">But, peace! For from broad words, and ‘cause he fail’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell</p>
			<p class="verseline">Where he bestows himself?</p>
			<p class="character">Lord</p>
			<p class="verseline">The son of Duncan,</p>
			<p class="verseline">From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Lives in the English court and is received</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of the most pious Edward with such grace</p>
			<p class="verseline">That the malevolence of fortune nothing</p>
			<p class="verseline">Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid</p>
			<p class="verseline">To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward;</p>
			<p class="verseline">That by the help of these, with Him above</p>
			<p class="verseline">To ratify the work, we may again</p>
			<p class="verseline">Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Do faithful homage, and receive free honors-</p>
			<p class="verseline">All which we pine for now. And this report</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath so exasperate the King that he</p>
			<p class="verseline">Prepares for some attempt of war</p>
			<p class="character">Lennox</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sent he to Macduff?</p>
			<p class="character">Lord</p>
			<p class="verseline">He did, and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”</p>
			<p class="verseline">The cloudy messenger turns me his back,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time</p>
			<p class="verseline">That clogs me with this answer.”</p>
			<p class="character">Lennox</p>
			<p class="verseline">And that well might</p>
			<p class="verseline">Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance</p>
			<p class="verseline">His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fly to the court of England and unfold</p>
			<p class="verseline">His message ere he come, that a swift blessing</p>
			<p class="verseline">May soon return to this our suffering country</p>

			<p class="verseline">The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will</p>

			<p class="verseline">I have no relish of them, but abound</p>

			<p class="verseline">From over-credulous haste. But God above</p>

			<p class="verseline">The devil to his fellow, and delight</p>
			<p class="verseline">No less in truth than life. My first false speaking</p>

			<p class="verseline">Where hearing should not latch them</p>
			<p class="character">Macduff</p>
			<p class="verseline">What concern they?</p>
			<p class="verseline">The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief</p>

			<p class="character">Ross</p>
			<p class="verseline">No mind that’s honest</p>

			<p class="verseline">Merciful heaven!</p>
			<p class="verseline">What, man! Neer pull your hat upon your brows;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak</p>

			<p class="verseline">I cannot but remember such things were</p>
			<p class="verseline">That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,</p>

			<p class="verseline">They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Not for their own demerits, but for mine,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</p>
			<p class="character">Malcolm</p>
			<p class="verseline">Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief</p>

			<p class="character">Doctor</p>
			<p class="prose">I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?</p>
			<p class="character">Gentlewoman</p>
			<p class="prose">Since his Majesty went into the field, have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep</p>
			<p class="character">Doctor</p>
			<p class="prose">A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?</p>
			<p class="character">Gentlewoman</p>
			<p class="verseline">That, sir, which I will not report after her</p>

			<p class="character">Doctor</p>
			<p class="verseline">How came she by that light?</p>
			<p class="character">Gentlewoman</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, it stood by her. She has light by her</p>

			<p class="verseline">What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands</p>
			<p class="character">Gentlewoman</p>
			<p class="prose">It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour</p>

			<p class="verseline">Yet here’s a spot</p>
			<p class="character">Doctor</p>
			<p class="prose">Hark, she speaks! I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly</p>
			<p class="character">Lady Macbeth</p>
			<p class="prose">Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One- two -why then ‘tis time to do’t. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?</p>
			<p class="character">Doctor</p>
			<p class="verseline">Do you mark that?</p>
			<p class="character">Lady Macbeth</p>
			<p class="prose">The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What, will these hands neer be clean? No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that. You mar all with this starting</p>
			<p class="character">Doctor</p>
			<p class="verseline">Go to, go to; you have known what you should not</p>
			<p class="character">Gentlewoman</p>
			<p class="verseline">She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that</p>
			<p class="verseline">Heaven knows what she has known</p>
			<p class="character">Lady Macbeth</p>
			<p class="prose">Here’s the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!</p>
			<p class="character">Doctor</p>
			<p class="verseline">What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged</p>
			<p class="character">Gentlewoman</p>
			<p class="prose">I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body</p>

			<p class="character">Doctor</p>
			<p class="verseline">Foul whisperings are abroad. Unnatural deeds</p>
			<p class="verseline">Do breed unnatural troubles; infected minds</p>

			<p class="verseline">More needs she the divine than the physician</p>
			<p class="verseline">God, God, forgive us all! Look after her;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Remove from her the means of all annoyance,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And still keep eyes upon her. So good night</p>
